# Movie Title Generator

## *fn(movielens data, markov chains) => title generator*


## *Why?*


## *Datasets*

The following main data sources were used for this project.

- [MovieLens](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)
- [MovieLens - |large 20 mill|](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/20m/)
- [MovieLens latest - |Largest 26mill|](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/)

### *MovieLens*

The MovieLens movie ratings data is provided by GroupLens Research in datasets ranging in size from 100K to 26 million. There is a "Latest" dataset that includes more recent ratings data up to 2016. I decided to use the latest research set of 26 million (MovieLens 26M) of ratings, tags, titles, and users.

### *JavaScript Implementation*




```

# Some rough speed metrics (HP Spectre x360, 2.7 GHz i7-7500U CPU):
$ time node generate.js
real    0m0.485s
user    0m0.000s
sys     0m0.030s

```

### *Results*



## *Next Steps*

This preliminary system can be developed further in a number of ways.

- Use system to generate songs, poetry, recipe's, & screen play's using various datasets.
